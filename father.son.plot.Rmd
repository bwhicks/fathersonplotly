## father.son data

This data set, from the `usingR` package, demonstrates the idea of regression to the mean based off the work of Sir [Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) during the late 19th century, comparing the height of sons to their fathers. 

## Visualization of father son data with Loess Smoother

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(UsingR)
library(plotly)
data(father.son)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

plot_ly(father.son, x = ~fheight) %>%
  add_markers(y = ~sheight, showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  add_lines(y = ~fitted(loess(sheight ~ fheight)),
            name = "Loess Smoother", showlegend = TRUE) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Father's Height (in.)"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Son's Height (in.)")
         )
